## Paid Listings

Paid listings to secure a spot in our directory by paying a fee. These listings gain more exposure than free listings, ensuring that businesses are prominently displayed to potential customers. By upgrading to a paid listing, you increase the chances of being noticed in a competitive space.

## Featured Listings

Even in free directories, we offer featured or boosted listings. Businesses can pay for a premium position at the top of the directory, ensuring maximum visibility. Featured listings are highlighted to stand out, making it easier for potential customers to find and engage with businesses.

Here‚Äôs an example of how featured listings will look to Minted Directory visitors:
